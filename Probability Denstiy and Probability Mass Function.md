## 1. Probability Density Function (PDF)

### 1.1 Definition
A Probability Density Function (PDF) describes the likelihood of a continuous random variable taking a specific value within a given range. It is represented by a function f(x)  such that for any two points  a and b  with a < b, the probability of x falling between a  and  b  is given by the integral:



### 1.2 Properties
- The PDF is non-negative:  f(x) geq 0 for all  x 
- The total area under the PDF curve over the entire range is equal to 1: 
- Probability of a point in a continuous distribution is zero: P(x = a) = 0 

### 1.3 Examples
- Normal Distribution
- Uniform Distribution
- Exponential Distribution

## 2. Probability Mass Function (PMF)

### 2.1 Definition
A Probability Mass Function (PMF) describes the probability of a discrete random variable taking on a specific value. It is represented by a function P(X = x) , which gives the probability of X taking the value x 

### 2.2 Properties
- The PMF is non-negative:P(X = x) \geq 0 for all  x 
- The sum of probabilities over all possible values equals 1: um P(X = x) = 1
- Probability of a range of values in a discrete distribution is obtained by summing the probabilities of individual points within the range.

### 2.3 Examples
- Bernoulli Distribution
- Binomial Distribution
- Poisson Distribution

## 3. Key Differences

### 3.1 Continuous vs. Discrete Distributions
- PDFs are used for continuous random variables, while PMFs are used for discrete random variables.

### 3.2 Probability vs. Probability Density
- In discrete distributions, probabilities are assigned directly to specific points. In continuous distributions, probabilities are defined over ranges.

### 3.3 Summation vs. Integration
- PMFs use summation to find probabilities, while PDFs use integration.

## 4. Applications

### 4.1 Real-world Examples
- PDFs: Modeling heights, weights, or other continuous measurements.
- PMFs: Modeling outcomes of experiments with a finite number of possible outcomes.

### 4.2 Use Cases
- PDFs: Engineering, physics, economics.
- PMFs: Coin flips, dice rolls, counting processes.

## 5. Summary and Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have covered the fundamental concepts of Probability Density Functions (PDFs) and Probability Mass Functions (PMFs). Understanding these functions is crucial for analyzing and modeling random phenomena in various fields.

Remember, PDFs are for continuous variables, and PMFs are for discrete variables. Additionally, the choice between them depends on the nature of the data you're working with.
