# Tutorial: Measurement of Central Tendency in Drug Discovery with Machine Learning

## Introduction

In the field of drug discovery, understanding the central tendency of data is crucial for making informed decisions. Central tendency measures provide insights into the typical or central value of a dataset. In this tutorial, we will explore how to apply measures of central tendency in the context of drug discovery using machine learning techniques.

## 1. Mean

The mean is a measure of central tendency that represents the average value of a dataset. It is calculated by summing up all the values and dividing by the number of observations.


## 2. Median

The median is the middle value in a sorted dataset. It is especially useful when dealing with skewed or non-normally distributed data. To find the median, sort the data and select the middle value. If the dataset has an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle values.

## 3. Mode

The mode represents the value that occurs most frequently in a dataset. It is useful for categorical or discrete data. A dataset can have one mode (unimodal) or multiple modes (multimodal).

### 4.3 Utilizing Measures for Decision Making

Understanding the central tendency helps in making decisions about which drug candidates to proceed with for further testing. For example, a drug with a higher mean response rate might be prioritized.

## 5. Conclusion

Measures of central tendency are essential tools in drug discovery and machine learning. They provide insights into the typical behavior of data, enabling informed decision-making. By applying mean, median, and mode, researchers can better understand and prioritize drug candidates for further development.

Remember, while this tutorial provides a theoretical overview, in practice, you would use libraries like NumPy, pandas, or scikit-learn in a Jupyter notebook to perform these computations on real-world data.
